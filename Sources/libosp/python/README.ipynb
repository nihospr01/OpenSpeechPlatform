    "\n",
    "1. [Notebooks that control (or provide a GUI for) a running OSP Process](osp/README.ipynb)\n",
    "2. [Notebooks used for development or testing](test) (Not recommended for normal users)\n",

    "\n",
    "## What are the RTMHA Python bindings?\n",
    "\n",
    "These allow developers to use python to create and interact with the internal RTMHA algorithms.  For example, you can use FIR filters, resample a signal, or use the 11-band multirate filterbank or WDRC to process an audio signal.\n",

    "We do not yet distribute these through PyPI.  Instead you must build the python bindings from the libosp directory.  The Cython package is required.  After you install it, simply type \"make python\"\n",
