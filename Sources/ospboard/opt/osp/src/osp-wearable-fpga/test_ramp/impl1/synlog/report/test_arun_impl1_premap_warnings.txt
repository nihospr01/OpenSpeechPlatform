@W: MT529 :"/home/hari/Documents/osp-wearable-fpga/test_ramp/test_togglepins.vhd":123:2:123:3|Found inferred clock test_togglepins|spi_clk which controls 18 sequential elements including rampcounter[11:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
