@W: MT529 :"/home/hari/Documents/osp-wearable-fpga/src/car_clock_gen.vhd":19:2:19:3|Found inferred clock pll_4|CLKOP_inferred_clock which controls 14 sequential elements including e_car_clock_gen.lvds_ctr[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
